  * Han, Yoseob, et al. "Deep learning with domain adaptation for accelerated projection‚Äêreconstruction MR." Magnetic resonance in medicine 80.3 (2018): 1189-1205. [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/mrm.27106, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01135.pdf]

Implementation
===============
* MatConvNet (matconvnet-1.0-beta20)
  * Please run the matconvnet-1.0-beta20/matlab/vl_compilenn.m file to compile matconvnet.
  * There is instruction on "http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/mfiles/vl_compilenn/"
* Domain adaptation for Projection Reconstruction MR (matconvnet-1.0-beta20/examples/deep-learning-with-domain-adaptation-for-PR-MR)
  * Please run the matconvnet-1.0-beta20/examples/deep-learning-with-domain-adaptation-for-PR-MR/install.m
  * Download the MR-only network, CT pre-trained network, and HCP pre-trained network

Trained network
===============
* MR-only network is uploaded.
* CT pre-trained network is uploaded.
* HCP pre-trained network is uploaded.
